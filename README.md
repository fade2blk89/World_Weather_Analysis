# World Weather Analysis #

## Overview ##
The purpose of this analysis is to help potential travelers beta test the PlanMyTrip app using the weather, hotel, and location data available from the Google Maps Platform APIs. Once the locations for their trip have been selected, we will then provide a full itinerary complete with directions using these same APIs. 

## Summary Finding ##
After receiving the desired temperature for minimum and maximum desired temperatures from the user input, we were able to show weather results for over 200 locations worldwide. In the end, we recommended a 4-city tour around Spain that included Arenys De Mar, Algete, Onda, and Zaragoza, complete with a map layer of the driving directions and a marker layer for the nearest hotels.
